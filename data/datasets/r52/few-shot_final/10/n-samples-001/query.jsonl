one the central banks signalled their displeasure so far g has been a roaring success said james o neill financial markets economist at marine midland bank na the central banks are sending strong signals that they won t tolerate any kind of momentum building behind currencies added a senior corporate trader at one u k bank on february the finance ministers and central bank governors of the u s japan west germany france and the u k the group of five plus canada signed an accord under which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around prevailing levels the agreement was viewed by many in the market as an attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable two year decline against major world currencies and initially traders indicated their respect for the accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower but by wednesday the dollar climbed to more than marks about five pfennigs above its levels the friday before the g accord the move was aided by indications that the u s economy picked up steam in february at the same time as the west german economy was regressing but dealers said the federal reserve bank of new york gave traders a sharp reminder that the g pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines dealers differed as to whether the u s central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above marks or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions but the dollar quickly backed off it hovered today around marks the market was surprised that the fed showed its face so soon said marine midland na s o neill also on wednesday london dealers said the bank of england intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the u k currency rose to dlrs compared with dlrs before the g pact sterling along with the other high yield currencies like the australian dollar and canadian dollar was in favor after traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant to the paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays on dollar mark and dollar yen the pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving u k economy anticipation

the central banks moves to stifle sudden upward movement leave the market uncertain about its next step today the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a very tight range against the dollar for several months the dollar fell to yen from last night analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long sterling short mark positions established lately because of the change in perceptions about the health of the german economy the funds from those unwinding operations are ending up in yen a dealer at one u k bank said recent west german data have shown falling industry orders lower industrial output and slowing employment gains moreover the yen is benefitting as japanese entities who have invested heavily overseas for example in australian financial instruments repatriate their profits ahead of the end of the japanese fiscal year on march noting that the dollar yen rate is in a sense the most controversial one because of the large u s trade deficit with japan analysts said the stage could be set for another test of the dollar s downward scope against the japanese currency in its latest review of the foreign exchange market through the end of january the federal reserve

interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its third world debt strategy a reagan administration official said the official s comments also suggest that debtors pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms in addition he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a megabank where third world debt would be pooled and suggested the administration would support such a plan even though it was not formally proposing it at the same time however the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground the philippine proposal together with argentine suggestions that exit bonds be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan the official said in an interview with reuters all of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered said the official who asked not to be named in october washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund imf were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations in return america called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation free economic growth the multilaterals have been performing well the debtors have been performing well said the official but he admitted that the largest third world debtor brazil was clearly an exception the official who played a key role in developing the u s debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the third world debt crisis we called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively the official said among those ideas the official said were suggestions that commercial banks create a megabank which could swap third world debt paper for so called exit bonds for banks like regional american or european institutions such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled and has been suggested by argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of billion dlrs he emphasised that the megabank was not an administration plan but something some people have suggested other u s officials said japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume third world debt this plan actively under consideration would differ slightly from the one the official described but the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the united states if the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go fine i don t think they ever will he pointed out that banks would swap their third world loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution meanwhile the official praised the philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than pct above libor the philippine proposal is very interesting it s quite unique and i don t think it s something that should be categorically rejected out of hand the official said banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of philippine investment notes these tradeable dollar denominated notes would have a six year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity the country would guarantee a payment of point over libor until now bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low the talks now in their second week are aimed at stretching out repayments of billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on billion of already rescheduled debt the country which has enjoyed strong political support in washington since corazon aquino came to power early last year owes an overall billion dlrs of debt but the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation a development until now unacceptable to the banks it s no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over libor from what existed before the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek some people argue that cutting the spread is debt forgiveness what it really is is narrowing the spread on new money he
